The Why
=========

There are quite a few libraries for data validation. Why another one?

It's declarative
---------------------
That is, readable. Class names reflect what is validated.
Their implementation doesn't clutter the higher-level validation logic description.
To get a feel of what it looks like, here is a quick example:

`an example goes here`

It's especially convenient in case of complex json data structures. Your validation structure reflects the request structure.

It's re-usable
---------------------
Each piece of validation logic is an object which can decorate existing validatable elements.

The How
=========


Indices and tables
